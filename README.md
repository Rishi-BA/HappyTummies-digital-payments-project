# HappyTummies – Online Food Ordering & Coupon Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the **complete business analysis documentation** for **HappyTummies**, a dual-interface system designed for both customers and administrators.  
It covers the **end-to-end BA project lifecycle** — from requirements gathering to solution design and testing — including BRD, FRD, user stories, use cases, wireframes, process flows, test cases, RTM, and supporting data.

---

## 🏦 Problem Statement
HappyTummies is currently operating only as a physical restaurant chain. This results in:
- Limited reach and no online ordering capability
- No centralized coupon or discount management system
- Manual handling of orders and promotions

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Develop a **web-based platform** with:
- **User Module** – Online food ordering, checkout, coupon redemption, order history  
- **Admin Module** – Coupon creation, coupon performance tracking, order management  
- Integration with backend for real-time order processing and promotion tracking
